Panel A) Uncertainty in a and b. This plot show a sample from the
joint posterior distribution of a and b. The dark circle is the best
estimate from the optimization. Panel B) Uncertainty in the SR
curves. The gray lines are SR curves based on samples from the joint
posterior distribution (panel A). The dashed line is the SR curve
corresponding to the best fit. The straight dotted line is the 1 to 1
line. The open circles are the SR data. The gray points are the
predicted recruits accounting for flow and marine survival. The black
points are the S at MSY for each of the SR relationships (some may not
be visible since they occur further to the right). Panel C) This shows
samples from the posterior distribution of S at SMSY, computed from
the SR parameter posterior draws in panel A. This SMSY is used to set
the upper threshold for the RER calculation.
